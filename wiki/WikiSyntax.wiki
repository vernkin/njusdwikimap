= 部分常用示例 =

== Paragraphs ==
Use one or more blank lines to separate paragraphs. 

== Typeface ==
||Name/Sample || *Markup* ||  
|| _italic_ || {{{_italic_}}}  ||
|| *bold* || {{{*bold*}}}  ||
|| `code` || {{{`code`}}}  ||
|| {{{code}}} || {{{{{{code}}}}}} ||  
|| ^super^script || {{{^super^script}}} || 
|| ,,sub,,script || {{{,,sub,,script}}}  ||
|| ~~strikeout~~ || {{{~~strikeout~~}}}  ||

You can mix these typefaces in some ways: 

|| *Markup* || *Result* ||  
|| {{{_*bold* in italics_}}} || _*bold* in italics_ ||  
|| {{{*_italics_ in bold*}}} || *_italics_ in bold* ||
|| {{{*~~strike~~ works too*}}} || *~~strike~~ works too* ||  
|| {{{~~as well as _this_ way round~~}}}  || ~~as well as _this_ way round~~ ||

== Code ==
If you have a multiline code block that you want to display verbatim, use the multiline code delimiter: 
{{{
  {{{
  def fib(n):  
    if n == 0 or n == 1:    
      return n  
    else:   
    # This recursion is not good for large numbers.    
      return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)
   }}}
}}}
Which results in: 

  {{{
  def fib(n):  
    if n == 0 or n == 1:    
      return n  
    else:   
    # This recursion is not good for large numbers.    
      return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)
   }}}

== Headings ==
{{{
  = Heading =
  == Subheading ==
  === Level 3 ===
  ==== Level 4 ====
  ===== Level 5 =====
  ====== Level 6 ======
}}}
Which results in: 

  = Heading =
  == Subheading ==
  === Level 3 ===
  ==== Level 4 ====
  ===== Level 5 =====
  ====== Level 6 ======


== Dividers ==
Four or more dashes on a line by themselves results in a horizontal rule.


== Lists ==
Google Code wikis support both bulleted and numbered lists. A list must be indented at least one space to be recognized as such. You can also nest lists one within the other by appropriate use of indenting: 

{{{
  The following is:  
    * A list  
    * Of bulleted items    
       # This is a numbered sublist    
       # Which is done by indenting further  
    * And back to the main bulleted list 
   * This is also a list 
   * With a single leading space 
   * Notice that it is rendered  
       # At the same levels  
       # As the above lists. 
    * Despite the different indentation levels.
}}}

The following is: 
    * A list  
    * Of bulleted items    
       # This is a numbered sublist    
       # Which is done by indenting further  
    * And back to the main bulleted list 
   * This is also a list 
   * With a single leading space 
   * Notice that it is rendered  
       # At the same levels  
       # As the above lists. 
    * Despite the different indentation levels.
